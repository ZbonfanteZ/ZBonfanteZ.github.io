<h1>Why Homework Harms Students</h1>

    <p>Homework in the past was used to practice skills learned in class and reinforce memory. Homework was invented by a man named Roberto Nevelis. The problem is that that was from the 16th century. Homework is an outdated practice that harms students and here is why.</p>

    <h2>Why Homework is Used</h2>
    <p>In the simplest terms, homework was created so that students could continue to practice exercises from class. By giving students homework, it requires students to continue the lessons from class at home.</p>

    <p>Homework harms students in many different ways. One is that it causes high levels of stress. Specifically for teens who are already stressing about a numerous amount of things, this just adds on making it more difficult for students. Another reason why homework harms students is because it makes it more difficult for students to have social lives or be apart of extracurricular activities because they are overloaded with assignments that are due. Students are already at school for 6 hours so when they get home, they want to spend time learning new skills instead of doing more school.
